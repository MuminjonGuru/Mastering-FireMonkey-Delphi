## Hello World! This is Muminjon
I am creating Delphi FireMonkey projects/prototypes for inspiration. It is free and you can also make contributions! [Delphi FireMonkey](https://www.embarcadero.com/products/delphi).

## Click the star button and follow me!

 - [Animations](https://github.com/MuminjonGuru/Mastering-FireMonkey-Delphi/tree/master/AdditionalAnimations) to include in your project
 - FireMonkey Animations powered [Login Form](https://github.com/MuminjonGuru/Mastering-FireMonkey-Delphi/tree/master/src)
 - _[TAnimator](https://github.com/MuminjonGuru/Mastering-FireMonkey-Delphi/tree/master/AnimateFloat)_ from **FMX.Ani**
 - **[ListOfMealsUIDemo](https://github.com/MuminjonGuru/Mastering-FireMonkey-Delphi/tree/master/ListOfMealsUIDemo)** with custom styles
 - **[QuizAppTemplate](https://github.com/MuminjonGuru/Mastering-FireMonkey-Delphi/tree/master/QuizAppTemplate)** for your Quiz Apps

What I have used? 

 - The TFloatAnimation component which gives you so many cool things that you can use for creating stunning animations without other resources.
 - Tab transition which lots of  new developer don’t use it. It is very simple, you just need to learn the TActionList component.
 - The TRectangle component. Why TRectangle not just TLayout or TPanel. Because the TRectangle is much more easy to use.
 - The System.Threading module that you can use it for creating multi-threaded applications.
 
## Also there are some additional animations for your Delphi FireMonkey Project 

Here you can see the demonstration of the Additional Animations: [src](https://photos.app.goo.gl/yDSLi9T9CxLbYXbj8)
