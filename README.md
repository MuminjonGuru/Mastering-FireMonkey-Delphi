What I have used? 

 - The TFloatAnimation component which gives you so many cool things that you can use for creating stunning animations without other resources.
 - Tab transition which lots of  new developer don’t use it. It is very simple, you just need to learn the TActionList component.
 - The TRectangle component. Why TRectangle not just TLayout or TPanel. Because the TRectangle is much more easy to use.
 - The System.Threading module that you can use it for creating multi-threaded applications.
